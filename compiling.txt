To compile this Perl project, you will need several things...

1/ ActiveState's Perl 5.8
2/ ActiveState's PDK 6
3/ A specially modified version of the Perl Win32::GUI module
   (found in the resources/ directory)
4/ This source code.  ;)
5/ UPX

Install Perl and PDK.  Use PPM to install the modified Win32::GUI module 
(the regular module found at CPAN will not do!).
If needed update appinfo.txt, and run make.bat!

PS: Set your editor's tab stops to 3.
