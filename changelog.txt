1.3.6 (22 Jul 2004) (unreleased)
	* Other: Made a minor adjustment to the "force-shifting" patch.
	* Other: Added warning message to the "force-recalibration" patch.
	* Other: Made a couple of very minor wording tweaks.

1.3.5 (18 Jul 2004)
	* Fixed: Fixed the 3S strat switching problem introduced in 1.3.4.  A safeguard that was introduced in 1.3.4 was too strict, causing this problem.

1.3.4 (18 Jul 2004)
	* Added: Support for auto-bitsetting for the 3S drives.
	* Added: Force-recalibration patch that will force the drive to recalibrate its laser towards the end of a 8x +R burn.  This is intended for people with high climbing error rates at the end of burns.
	* Removed: Force-fallback.
	* Fixed: Strategy swapping on the US0J firmware is no longer improperly handled (this bug does not seem to affect any firmwares other than US0J).
	* Other: The "blinking orange light" label has been renamed to "dead drive blink" in order to reduce confusion with buffer underrun blinks and with drives that use other colors.
	* Other: Made a minor adjustment to the "force-shifting" patch.

1.3.3 (10 Jul 2004)
	* Other: Slightly changed the way OmniPatcher gives warnings.
	* Other: Added error message if the recommended tweaks button is clicked and there is no recommended tweaks file present.
	* Other: Minor updates to some of the build libraries.

1.3.2 (8 Jul 2004)
	* Added: Force-fallback patch that will slow down high-speed +R burns at the end.  This is intended for people with high climbing error rates at the end of burns.
	* Added: There is now a note about the use of the double-click in the interface.
	* Added: Warning message when trying to modify the speeds of +RW media.
	* Improved: The old "Apply recommended write strategy replacements" feature has been overhauled and renamed.
	* Improved: The formatting of the media code report has been refined.
	* Improved: The sorting of +R/W media codes into +R and +RW has been improved (this fixes a sorting problem with a few of the old firmwares).
	* Fixed: Loading an incompatible firmware could, under certain circumstances, cause OmniPatcher to crash.  This has been resolved.
	* Other: The handling of disallowed speeds has been changed.  Instead of disabling them, they are now hidden to reduce clutter.
	* Other: Minor changes in some texts throughout the program, including a renaming of "shift-fixing" to "force-shifting".
	* Other: The documentation was revised.

1.3.1 (6 Jul 2004)
	* Fixed: When removing (unpatching) strategy replacements from a patched firmware, the removal would not always be successful.  The bug causing this has been fixed.

1.3.0 (5 Jul 2004)
	* Added: Ability to do write strategy replacements. (unlike swaps, replacements do not carry the ill side effects to the "host" code)
	* Improved: The media code report format has been improved for better readability.
	* Improved: The handling of the RICOHJPNR00 firmware bug has been changed.
	* Fixed: Very minor bug with the media speed hacking process.  This bug was minor in the sense that it would almost never be triggered.
	* Fixed: Very minor bug in the file saving process.  This bug did not affect the saved file.
	* Fixed: For the sake of clarity and consistency, 'DL' was renamed to 'R9' in the reading speed patch description.

1.2.0 (28 Jun 2004)
	* Removed: No more support for scrambled/compressed flashers.  OmniPatcher will no longer work with these flashers.
	* Improved: Optimized code for faster file loading.
	* Fixed: Minor problems with detecting the flasher type.
	* Fixed: The crossflashing checkbox is now disabled for GSU1 and GSC_ (it never had any effect on these firmwares anyway).

1.1.2 (16 Jun 2004)
	* Fixed: File open error in Windows 9x/ME (does not affect 2K/XP).

1.1.1 (16 Jun 2004)
	* Fixed: Problems with opening certain .EXE files.

1.1.0 (15 Jun 2004)
	* Added: Ability to save an executable firmware flasher as a raw firmware (.BIN).
	* Added: New feature: all executable firmware flashers are now FlashFixed when saved (FF does not alter the firmware).
	* Other: Updated the XFlash-X libraries used to build the executable; OmniPatcher can now much better handle executable firmware flashers.

1.0.3 (11 Jun 2004)
	* Fixed: Bug with hacking writing speeds on *13S firmwares.

1.0.2 (11 Jun 2004)
	* Fixed: OmniPatcher can now correctly handle the new *13S firmwares.

1.0.1 (10 Jun 2004)
	* Added: Ability to save a report of the media codes to a text file.
	* Fixed: Color problems with the Windows XP "Luna" theme.
	* Fixed: The documentation now warns against +RW speedhacking.
	* Other: Changed/updated the libraries used to build the executable.

1.0.0 (6 Jun 2004)
	* First version.
