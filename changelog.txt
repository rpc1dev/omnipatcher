1.3.1 (6 Jul 2004)
	* Fixed: When removing (unpatching) strategy replacements from a patched firmware, the removal would not always be successful.  The bug causing this has been fixed.

1.3.0 (5 Jul 2004)
	* Added: Ability to do write strategy replacements. (unlike swaps, replacements do not carry the ill side effects to the "host" code)
	* Improved: The media code report format has been improved for better readability.
	* Improved: The handling of the RICOHJPNR00 firmware bug has been changed.
	* Fixed: Very minor bug with the media speed hacking process.  This bug was minor in the sense that it would almost never be triggered.
	* Fixed: Very minor bug in the file saving process.  This bug did not affect the saved file.
	* Fixed: For the sake of clarity and consistency, 'DL' was renamed to 'R9' in the reading speed patch description.

1.2.0 (28 Jun 2004)
	* Removed: No more support for scrambled/compressed flashers.  OmniPatcher will no longer work with these flashers.
	* Improved: Optimized code for faster file loading.
	* Fixed: Minor problems with detecting the flasher type.
	* Fixed: The crossflashing checkbox is now disabled for GSU1 and GSC_ (it never had any effect on these firmwares anyway).

1.1.2 (16 Jun 2004)
	* Fixed: File open error in Windows 9x/ME (does not affect 2K/XP).

1.1.1 (16 Jun 2004)
	* Fixed: Problems with opening certain .EXE files.

1.1.0 (15 Jun 2004)
	* Added: Ability to save an executable firmware flasher as a raw firmware (.BIN).
	* Added: New feature: all executable firmware flashers are now FlashFixed when saved (FF does not alter the firmware).
	* Other: Updated the XFlash-X libraries used to build the executable; OmniPatcher can now much better handle executable firmware flashers.

1.0.3 (11 Jun 2004)
	* Fixed: Bug with hacking writing speeds on *13S firmwares.

1.0.2 (11 Jun 2004)
	* Fixed: OmniPatcher can now correctly handle the new *13S firmwares.

1.0.1 (10 Jun 2004)
