2.0.0 (12 Jun 2005)
	* Note: Version 2 is a major re-write.  The internals have been completely re-worked, and virtually every line of code was rewritten, with the goal of making OmniPatcher more robust and more maintainable.
	* Added: "Fix bitsetting support" patch (this supersedes both of the now-deprecated bitsetting-fix mini-patchers).
	* Added: "Fix LED colors" patch.
	* Added: "Disable media learning" patch (experimental).
	* Added: Ability to rename media codes.
	* Added: Ability to rename a drive to one of its equivalent OEM names.
	* Added: Ability to specify a file for OmniPatcher to load from the command line (which allows Windows to associate .BIN files with OmniPatcher, if so desired).
	* Added: Ability to load a file by dragging it into the OmniPatcher window.
	* Added: Command line flag to dump OmniPatcher's event log for troubleshooting.
	* Improved: Completely new interface.
	* Improved: New and improved reading speed patch and interface.
	* Improved: Irrelevant patches are now hidden to avoid confusion.
	* Improved: Saving a file or a media code report now provides a default save name.
	* Improved: New strategy reassignment patch routines.  Now, if there is insufficient space in a given bank, strategy reassignment will be disabled for only that bank and not for the entire firmware.  Also fixed a minor bug with some of the 3S patches.
	* Improved: Both the standard and internal firmware revisions are now reported (OmniPatcher used to report only the internal revision).
	* Improved: Drive type detection has been refined slightly.
	* Improved: The format for the media code report has been improved slightly.
	* Removed: The rec_tweaks.conf file is no longer used.  The list of tweaks is now embedded in the executable.  Since the tweaks file is being updated about as frequently as OmniPatcher, it does not make sense to have it as a separate download.
	* Fixed: The [ENTER] and [ESC] keys now work correctly in the pick-a-strategy dialog box.
	* Other: Updated documentation.
	* Other: Tweaked the program name slightly.
	* Other: Updated build libraries.

1.4.3 (30 May 2005)
	* Other: Updated the compilation process.  OmniPatcher should look a lot better now on computers using the Windows XP Luna theme.
	* Other: Updated some of the supporting code.
	* Removed: OmniPatcher will no longer FlashFix a flasher.

1.4.2 (1 May 2005)
	* Improved: There is now a lot more information displayed in the firmware information dialog.
	* Changed: New formatting in the media report.
	* Changed: 1673S -R9 media is now displayed in the media report with no speeds allocated.

1.4.1 (20 Apr 2005)
	* Added: Support for firmwares that have -R9 media.

	* Fixed: OmniPatcher now supports the new 14/28-byte +R table format used in BYX2.

1.3.17a (27 Nov 2004)
	* Fixed: Crash when loading TSD1.

1.3.17 (24 Nov 2004)
	* Fixed: Since LiteOn has decided to make the 1633S a 12x -R burner, the 12x -R checkbox is no longer hidden for 1633S firmwares.
	* Fixed: Reworked the handling of speeds for slimtype drives.  Thanks go to those who tested.

1.3.16b (19 Nov 2004)
	* Fixed: OmniPatcher no longer incorrectly warns about not finding enough tables when loading the BY02 firmware.

1.3.16a (14 Nov 2004)
	* Improved: The reading speed patch checkbox is now checked and disabled (vs. unchecked and disabled) if the patch cannot be applied because all of the speeds are already at the maximum.
	* Fixed: The 4x -RW checkbox is no longer hidden for 1S drives.
	* Other: Adjusted the compilation process to produce a slightly smaller executable.
	* Other: Updated documentation to specify that some of the patches (the ones that always appear disabled with 3S firmwares) are intended for only the 1S and 2S drives.

	* Added: Basic media support for the slimtype drives.
	* Added: Experimental support for the 1673S.
	* Added: Crossflashing support for 401S@411S.  This feature would most likely never see much use, but since ala42 was kind enough to supply the patch information, it might as well be added. :-)

	* Other: Switched to a different compiler, resulting in a smaller file size.

1.3.13 (2 Oct 2004)
	* Added: A new "Info" button that displays general information about the loaded firmware.
	* Fixed: OmniPatcher crashing upon startup on Windows 2000. (thanks, rdgrimes)
	* Other: Modified (once again) the formatting of the media codes report.  By request, the OmniPatcher version is now included in the report file.

1.3.12 (27 Sep 2004)
	* Other: Updated one of the libraries used to build the executable.

	* Improved: OmniPatcher will now display the true firmware revision.
	* Improved: The media code report format has been revised somewhat.
	* Fixed: Strategy switching works for TS0C.
	* Fixed: 6x/8x -R speeds are no longer shown for 1S firmwares, 12x/16x -R speeds are no longer shown for 3S firmwares, and 16x +R speeds are no longer shown for 1213S firmwares.

1.3.8 (26 Jul 2004)
	* Added: Force-fallback.
	* Removed: Force-recalibration.
	* Fixed: RW speed selection for the 3S drives no longer incorrectly displays invalid 6x and 8x options.
	* Fixed: Very minor issue with loading a rec_tweak.conf file with invalid entries.

1.3.7 (24 Jul 2004)
	* Added: Support for the 1613S/1633S.

	* Other: Made a couple of very minor wording tweaks.

1.3.5 (18 Jul 2004)
	* Fixed: Fixed the 3S strat switching problem introduced in 1.3.4.  A safeguard that was introduced in 1.3.4 was too strict, causing this problem.

1.3.4 (18 Jul 2004)
	* Added: Support for auto-bitsetting for the 3S drives.
	* Added: Force-recalibration patch that will force the drive to recalibrate its laser towards the end of a 8x +R burn.  This is intended for people with high climbing error rates at the end of burns.
	* Removed: Force-fallback.
	* Fixed: Strategy swapping on the US0J firmware is no longer improperly handled (this bug does not seem to affect any firmwares other than US0J).
	* Other: The "blinking orange light" label has been renamed to "dead drive blink" in order to reduce confusion with buffer underrun blinks and with drives that use other colors.
	* Other: Made a minor adjustment to the "force-shifting" patch.

1.3.3 (10 Jul 2004)
	* Other: Slightly changed the way OmniPatcher gives warnings.
	* Other: Added error message if the recommended tweaks button is clicked and there is no recommended tweaks file present.
	* Other: Minor updates to some of the build libraries.

1.3.2 (8 Jul 2004)
	* Added: Force-fallback patch that will slow down high-speed +R burns at the end.  This is intended for people with high climbing error rates at the end of burns.
	* Added: There is now a note about the use of the double-click in the interface.
	* Added: Warning message when trying to modify the speeds of +RW media.
	* Improved: The old "Apply recommended write strategy replacements" feature has been overhauled and renamed.
	* Improved: The formatting of the media code report has been refined.
	* Improved: The sorting of +R/W media codes into +R and +RW has been improved (this fixes a sorting problem with a few of the old firmwares).
	* Fixed: Loading an incompatible firmware could, under certain circumstances, cause OmniPatcher to crash.  This has been resolved.
	* Other: The handling of disallowed speeds has been changed.  Instead of disabling them, they are now hidden to reduce clutter.
	* Other: Minor changes in some texts throughout the program, including a renaming of "shift-fixing" to "force-shifting".
	* Other: The documentation was revised.

1.3.1 (6 Jul 2004)
	* Fixed: When removing (unpatching) strategy replacements from a patched firmware, the removal would not always be successful.  The bug causing this has been fixed.

1.3.0 (5 Jul 2004)
	* Added: Ability to do write strategy replacements. (unlike swaps, replacements do not carry the ill side effects to the "host" code)
	* Improved: The media code report format has been improved for better readability.
	* Improved: The handling of the RICOHJPNR00 firmware bug has been changed.
	* Fixed: Very minor bug with the media speed hacking process.  This bug was minor in the sense that it would almost never be triggered.
	* Fixed: Very minor bug in the file saving process.  This bug did not affect the saved file.
	* Fixed: For the sake of clarity and consistency, 'DL' was renamed to 'R9' in the reading speed patch description.

1.2.0 (28 Jun 2004)
	* Removed: No more support for scrambled/compressed flashers.  OmniPatcher will no longer work with these flashers.
	* Improved: Optimized code for faster file loading.
	* Fixed: Minor problems with detecting the flasher type.
	* Fixed: The crossflashing checkbox is now disabled for GSU1 and GSC_ (it never had any effect on these firmwares anyway).

1.1.2 (16 Jun 2004)
	* Fixed: File open error in Windows 9x/ME (does not affect 2K/XP).

1.1.1 (16 Jun 2004)
	* Fixed: Problems with opening certain .EXE files.

1.1.0 (15 Jun 2004)
	* Added: Ability to save an executable firmware flasher as a raw firmware (.BIN).
	* Added: New feature: all executable firmware flashers are now FlashFixed when saved (FF does not alter the firmware).
	* Other: Updated the XFlash-X libraries used to build the executable; OmniPatcher can now much better handle executable firmware flashers.

1.0.3 (11 Jun 2004)
	* Fixed: Bug with hacking writing speeds on *13S firmwares.

1.0.2 (11 Jun 2004)
